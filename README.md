##  Why Use List Comprehension?
- Cleaner code
- Faster execution
- Common in data transformation and filtering
- Great for data analysts and developers

  ## What is list comprehension?

- List comprehensions are great because they let you create new lists by applying a transformation or filter to an existing list—all in one concise line.
- They’re faster and easier to read than traditional for loops.
- As data analysts, we often work with datasets and need to transform or filter data quickly, and list comprehension makes that process smoother.

  ##  How Does It Work?
  Syntax: `[expression for item in iterable if condition]`
  - `expression` is what you want to do with each item
  - `iterable` is the list or data source
  - `condition` is optional; it lets you filter
 
  ## Real-World Example (Data Analyst)
  Task: A data analyst working in e-commerce has a list of customer reviews, and he wants to pull out only the ones that mention ‘fast delivery.’
Here’s how list comprehension could help:

   Now, `fast_reviews` contains only the relevant feedback, ready for further analysis or reporting.
